List of changes to 'pyhdf' since the initial release.

pyhdf-0.5-2
  August 3 2003
    -After starting the implementation of another HDF API, it
     was found that the idea of having on C extension module
     per HDF API was not a good one. It made difficult the sharing
     of HDF data structures between the C extension modules.
     It was thus decided to have just one C extension module
     shared between all the python modules.
    -The new C extension module is named "_hdfext". The SD python 
     module has been modified to import "_hdfext" instead of "_sdext".
    -A new "error" module has been added.

pyhdf-0.5-1
  July 31 2003
    -Initial release.
