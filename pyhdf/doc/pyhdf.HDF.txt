    Introduction
    ------------
    The role of the HDF module is to provide support to other modules of the
    pyhdf package. It defines constants specifying file opening modes and
    various data types, methods for accessing files, plus a few utility
    functions to query library version and check if a file is an HDF one.
    
    It should be noted that, among the modules of the pyhdf package, SD is
    special in the sense that it is self-contained and does not need support
    from the HDF module. For example, SD provides its own file opening and
    closing methods, whereas VS uses methods of the HDF.HDF class for that.
    
    Functions and classes summary
    -----------------------------
    The HDF module provides the following classes.
    
      HC
          The HC class holds constants defining opening modes and
          various data types.
    
      HDF
          The HDF class provides methods to open and close an HDF file,
          and return instances of the major HDF APIs (except SD).
    
          To instantiate an HDF class, call the HDF() constructor.
    
          methods:
            constructors:
              HDF()     open an HDF file, creating the file if necessary,
                        and return an HDF instance
              vstart()  initialize the VS (Vdata) API over the HDF file and
                        return a VS instance
              vgstart() initialize the V (Vgroup) interface over the HDF file
                        and return a V instance.
              
    
            closing file
              close()  close the HDF file
    
            inquiry
              getfileversion()  return info about the version of the  HDF file 
                       
    The HDF module also offers the following functions.
    
      inquiry
        getlibversion()    return info about the version of the library
        ishdf()            determine whether a file is an HDF file

CLASSES
    HDF
    
    class HDF
     |  The HDF class encapsulates the basic HDF functions.
     |  Its main use is to open and close an HDF file, and return
     |  instances of the major HDF APIs (except for SD).
     |  To instantiate an HDF class, call the HDF() constructor.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __del__(self)
     |      Delete the instance, first calling the end() method 
     |      if not already done.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, path, mode=1, nblocks=0)
     |      HDF constructor: open an HDF file, creating the file if
     |      necessary.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |        path    name of the HDF file to open
     |        mode    file opening mode; this mode is a set of binary flags
     |                which can be ored together
     |                    
     |                    HC.CREATE   combined with HC.WRITE to create file 
     |                                if it does not exist
     |                    HC.READ     open file in read-only access (default)
     |                    HC.TRUNC    if combined with HC.WRITE, overwrite
     |                                file if it already exists
     |                    HC.WRITE    open file in read-write mode; if file
     |                                exists it is updated, unless HC.TRUNC is
     |                                set, in which case it is erased and
     |                                recreated; if file does not exist, an
     |                                error is raised unless HC.CREATE is set,
     |                                in which case the file is created
     |      
     |                 Note an important difference in the way CREATE is
     |                 handled by the HDF C library and the pyhdf package.
     |                 In the C library, CREATE indicates that a new file should
     |                 always be created, overwriting an existing one if
     |                 any. For pyhdf, CREATE indicates a new file should be
     |                 created only if it does not exist, and the overwriting
     |                 of an already existing file must be explicitly asked
     |                 for by setting the TRUNC flag.
     |      
     |                 Those differences were introduced so as to harmonize
     |                 the way files are opened in the pycdf and pyhdf
     |                 packages. Also, this solves a limitation in the
     |                 hdf (and netCDF) library, where there is no easy way
     |                 to implement the frequent requirement that an existent
     |                 file be opened in read-write mode, or created
     |                 if it does not exist.
     |      
     |        nblocks  number of data descriptor blocks in a block wit which
     |                 to create the file; the parameter is ignored if the file
     |                 is not created; 0 asks to use the default
