Installing pyhdf
================

``pyhdf`` has been successfully installed under Python 2.4 and above on
several platforms, including 

* Windows XP

* Linux 2.4.19

* Tru64 4.0.f

* Solaris 8

* AIX 4

* MacOSX 10.5.

Please inform the maintainer (Andre.Gosselin@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) of any
problems encountered during installation.

There are several available options for installing pyhdf:

1.  Download and install EPD version 2.5.3001 (Enthought Python Distribution)
    which includes pyhdf 0.8.  This makes sense if Python isn't already
    installed on you computer.
2.  Download and install pyhdf 0.8 from PyPi / the cheeseshop.
3.  Download and install pyhdf 0.8 from source


1. Installing EPD
-----------------

EPD (The Enthought Python Distribution) is a python release which includes
many of the major python packages (such as NumPy, SciPy, etc), along
with pyhdf.  As such, you don't need to worry about install other packages.
The EPD is available at 
`the Enthought website <http://www.enthought.com>`_.
Follow the instructions on the page.


2. Installing from the Cheeseshop
---------------------------------

**Requirements**:

- Python 2.5+
- Numpy 1.1+

The Python Package Index, also known as the Cheeseshop, is
a site on the web where many open-source python packages are stored.

a. Install Python 2.5+: go to `the Python webpage <http://www.python.org>`_
   and follow the instructions to install Python

b. Install Numpy 1.1+: go to `the Scipy webpage <http://www.scipy.org>`_
   and follow the instructions to install Numpy

c. Install PyHDF v0.8+: open a command prompt in the main python directory 
    and type::

        easy_install pyHDF


3. Install from Source
----------------------

**Requirements**:

- Python v2.5+
- Subversion
- Numpy v1.1+
- GCC Compiler suite
- HDF4.2r1 libraries
- Pyhdf v0.8

This option requires that you download and install Python, Subversion,
Numpy and the GCC compiler suite before you download and install pyhdf.

a. Install Python 2.5+: go to `the Python webpage <http://www.python.org>`_
   and follow the instructions to install Python

b. Install Numpy 1.1+: go to `the Scipy webpage <http://www.scipy.org>`_
   and follow the instructions to install Numpy

c. Install the GCC compiler: go to http://gcc.gnu.org and follow the
   instructions to download and install the GCC C and FORTRAN
   compilers.

d. Download the HDF4.x libraries: go to http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/ and
   follow the download instructions. Prebuilt binaries are available
   for most platforms.  Note that HDF4.2 itself depends on libjpeg and
   libz (and optionally libsz for SZIP compression).

e. Install Subversion: go to http://www.tigris.org and follow the
   instructions to install Subversion. If you are a Windows user it is
   worthwhile to also download and install TortoiseSVN which
   integrates a user friendly interface to SVN in to Windows Explorer.

f. Download pyhdf using Subversion: There are several ways to download
   pyhdf with Subversion. From the command prompt::

     svn checkout https://pysclint.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pysclint/trunk/pyhdf

   Binaries and source tarballs can be downloaded from the
   `SourceForge project page <http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pysclint>`_.

Step-by-step instructions for installing pyhdf
----------------------------------------------

1. Go to the ``pyhdf`` source directory.

2. If your HDF4 libraries or include files reside in directories
   that are not searched by default on your system,
   the installation script will complain about missing files.

   Add to the search path by exporting ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` and
   ``LIBRARY_DIRS``, e.g.::

        export INCLUDE_DIRS="/usr/local/hdf-4.2r1/include"
        export LIBRARY_DIRS="/usr/local/hdf-4.2r1/lib"

        (or SET INCLUDE_DIRS="C:\\hdf4" on Windows)

   In case szlib is available, also set ``SZIP``::

        export SZIP=1

   If anything goes wrong, read the detailed notes below.
   Warning messages about implicit declarations of some functions
   may be produced.  Those are due to SWIG, and may be safely
   ignored.

3. Install system-wide or locally::

        # sudo python setup.py install
        $ python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local (or prefix of choice)

To make sure everything works as expected, run the ``hdfstruct.py``
script (under ``examples/hdfstruct``) on one of your HDF4 files. The
script should display the file structure. This is a handy tool to have
around when you want to explore the contents of any HDF4 file.

Further notes
=============

External libraries
------------------

HDF4.2 no longer provides its own copies of the jpeg and z libraries.
Those must be installed separately (on Linux, they should be part of
any standard distribution).

The sz library (versions 2.0 or higher) must be installed if the SZIP
compression method is to be used with SDsetcompress(). HDF v4.2 must
also then be compiled with SZIP support. Precompiled HDF packages
usually lack this feature. Getting an SZIP enabled HDF library may
require compiling the library from source with the "--with-szlib"
configuration option.  Note that you *must* install SZIP in a separate
step. For more details, see the
`NCSA hdf site <http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/>`_.
Source code and binaries are
`available for download <ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/lib-external/szip/>`_.

In case your HDF library was compiled without SZIP support, or you cannot
abide by the szip licensing terms, set the ``szip_installed`` variable
inside 'setup.py' to ``False``.

If you get error messages related to the ``SDgetcompress()`` /
``SDsetcompress()`` functions, e.g. ``"undefined symbol:
SDgetcompress"``, set the environment variable ``NO_COMPRESS`` to "1".
This will transform ``SDgetcompress()`` and ``SDsetcompress()`` into
no-ops, which will immediately raise an exception, and will not be
resolved against the HDF library symbols. This may make it possible to
work with an HDF library earlier than v4.2.

Swig-generated interface files
------------------------------
Interface files ``hdfext.py`` and ``hdfext_wrap.c`` (located under the
``pyhdf`` subdirectory) have been generated using the SWIG tool.
Those two files should be usable as is on most environments.  It could
happen however that, for reasons related to your environment, your C
compiler does not accept the '.c' file and raises a compilation
error. If so, the interface needs to be regenerated.  To do so,
install `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_, then run::

  $ cd pyhdf
  $ swig -python hdfext.i

SWIG should silently regenerate the two interface files, after which
installation should proceed correctly.

TRU64 note
----------
The HDF installation creates its libraries as archive (.a) files,
not shareable (.so) ones. On TRU64, the linker by default first looks
for shareable libraries in every directory, then in a second round
for archive files. This means that if there is a libjpeg.so somewhere
on the standard linker search paths, it will be found first, even if
the HDF libjpeg.a file exists in the directory pointed by "library_dirs".
To solve the problem, set the environment variable ``LINK_ARGS``::

  export LINK_ARGS="-oldstyle_liblookup"

This will tell the linker to look for .so then for .a files in each visited
directory.
