Installing the pycdf python package.

pyhdf has been successfully installed under python 2.2 on
the following platforms:
  -Linux, kernel 2.4.19 and above
  -Tru64 4.0.f and above
  -Solaris 8
  -AIX 4

Please inform the author (gosselina@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) of any
successfull installation on a different platform, and of
problems encountered.

To install, follow these steps.

1-Install the HDF4 library. Source code is available at:
  http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf4.html. Binary packages
  are available for most popular environments.

2-Install the python Numeric package. Source code is
  available at: numpy.sourceforge.net. Binary packages
  are available for most popular environments.
  Note that version 22 or above is needed to compile
  support for unsigned integer types. See details inside
  `setup.py' if you want to use an earlier version of Numeric.

3-Uncompress and untar the pyhdf tar ball, then cd to the
  pyhdf-xxx directory just created.

4-If your HDF4 libraries or include files reside in directories
  that are not searched by default on your system,
  the installation script wil complain about missing files.
  In that case, edit the `setup.py' file and locate the 
  lines reading:

    #include_dirs=["non standard path where hdf includes live"],
    #library_dirs=["non standard path where libs live"],

  Remove the pound sign to uncomment the line(s) to edit, and enter 
  the required paths in quotes between the square brackets. For ex.,
  if at your site HDF has been installed in directory
  "/usr/local/hdf4", enter:

    include_dirs = ["/usr/local/hdf4/include"]
    library_dirs = ["/usr/local/hdf4/lib"],

  The HDF installation comes with its own 'jpeg' and 'z' (compression)
  library. This could cause trouble, since other versions of those
  libraries may also be installed on your system. If this is the case, 
  it is important that pyhdf be linked against the HDF versions of 'jpeg' 
  and 'z', *not* the other ones. The setup script will tell the linker to
  first look in the directories specified by "library_dirs", and this may
  be a good reason to set this parameter in the first place.

  TRU64 note
    The HDF installation creates its libraries as archive (.a) files,
    not shareable (.so) ones. On TRU64, the linker by default first looks
    for shareable libraries in every directory, then in a second round
    for archive files. This means that if there is a libjpeg.so somewhere 
    on the standard linker search paths, it will be found first, even if 
    the HDF libjpeg.a file exists in the directory pointed by "library_dirs". 
    To solve the problem, edit the line:
   
      #extra_link_args=["extra stuff passed to the linker"],

    changing it to:

      extra_link_args = ["-oldstyle_liblookup"],

    This will tell the linker to look for .so then for .a files in each visited
    directory.


5-As root, execute the command:

    python setup.py install

Enjoy!
