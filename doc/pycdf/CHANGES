List of changes to 'pycdf' since the initial release.

pycdf-0.5-4
  August 14 2005
    Bug fix release.

    -Fixed a bad 'raise' statement in CDF.__init()__ method.
     (thanks: E.Bernsen@phys.uu.nl who reported this bug)
    -Fixed an infinite loop condition in the CDF.__del__() method when
     trying to open a non-existent file.
     (thanks: E.Bernsen@phys.uu.nl who reported this bug)
    -Fixed bug in CDF.def_var() method : the number of dimensions was not
     always correctly computed.
     (thanks: badland@broadpark.no who reported this bug)
    -Fixed bug in the handling of scalar variables inside methods
     get() and put(), and slicing expression "v[:]". Added a new section
     "Working with scalar variables" in the documentation.
     (thanks: gerry@ucar.edu for reporting this bug)
    -Fixed a bug with assignments to variables based on an unlimited dimension. 
     Added a new section "Working with the unlimited dimension" in
     the documentation.
     (thanks to sdhyok@email.unc.edu for reporting this bug)
    -Added a new section "Open issues and current limitations" to the
     documentation.
    -Added some comments about the '_FillValue' attribute inside the documentation.
     
pycdf-0.5-3
  July 16 2005
    Interim release.
    
    -pycdf classes are now 'new-style' classes (they derive from 'object').
    -Updated documentation.

pycdf-0.5-2
  July 20 2003
    -Corrected unfortunate error in the 'setup.py' script.
    -Forced closing of the dataset when the python object
     referring to it goes out of scope.
    -To avoid name clashes with an upcoming 'pyhdf' package,
     all netCDF constants heve been moved to a new 'NC' class.
     As a consequence, instead of saying eg:"CDF(<file>,READ)", 
     one must now write: "CDF(<file>,NC.READ). Since this change 
     comes really early in the lifetime of 'pycdf', it is hoped 
     it will not impact too many users.
     *** EXAMPLES MUST BE DOWNLOADED AFRESH ***
    -List of names imported by an "from pycdf import *" statement
     has been substantially cleaned up.

pycdf-0.5-1
  July 19 2003
    -Initial release.
