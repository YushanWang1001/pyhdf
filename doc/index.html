<h1><strong>pysclint</strong> - A collection of python interfaces
to major scientific libraries</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>pysclint</strong> is a set of python packages aimed at providing high quality python interfaces &nbsp;to major scientific libraires like <em>netCDF</em>,
<em>HDF</em>, and <em>MPI</em>. The packages are written so as to stay very close to the original libraries structure and intent. They try to encompass and respect as much of the libraries API&#039;s as possible, with no attempt at redesigning them, correcting their supposed flaws, &nbsp;or rewriting their documentation. As for this last point, being able to easily refer to &nbsp;a library original documentation while using its python interface was always considered an important objective.
    </p>
<p>At the same time,<strong> pysclint</strong> &nbsp;tries to wrap the API&#039;s in a natural pythonic paradigm, augmenting it with &nbsp;an OOP approach whenever appropriate. A major goal was to make a user of the original API (usually in C) feel &nbsp;at home with the python version, and &nbsp;conversely not require any previous experience with this API when first learning it through its pysclint interface.
    </p>
<p>The following interfaces are currently provided.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pycdf</strong> - Python interface to the Unidata&nbsp;<em>netCDF</em> library. See the <A href="pycdf/index.html">pycdf</A> web page.
      </li>
<li><strong>pyhdf</strong> - Python interface to the &nbsp;NCSA
<em>HDF4</em> library. See the <A href="pyhdf/index.html">pyhdf</A> web page.
      </li>
</ul>
     An interface to the MPI 1.2 standard will be provided in a near future.
     
<p>The packages making up pysclint were previously hosted at Institut Maurice-Lamontagne (IML).
It became more practical to move the project to Sourceforge, which was done in July 2005.
We want to thank IML for it previous support.</p>
