<h1>pysclint - A collection of python interfaces to major
scientific libraries</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p><strong>pysclint</strong> is a set of python
packages aimed at providing high quality python interfaces &nbsp;to
major scientific libraires like <em>netCDF</em>,
<em>HDF</em>, and <em>MPI</em>. The packages
are written so as to stay very close to the original libraries
structure and intent. They try to encompass and respect as much of the
libraries API's as possible, with no attempt at redesigning them,
correcting their supposed flaws, &nbsp;or rewriting their
documentation. As for this last point, being able to easily refer to
&nbsp;a library original documentation while using its python
interface was always considered an important objective. </p>


<p>At the same time,<strong> pysclint</strong>
&nbsp;tries to wrap the API's in a natural pythonic paradigm,
augmenting it with &nbsp;an OOP approach whenever appropriate. A
major goal was to make a user of the original API (usually in C) feel
&nbsp;at home with the python version, and &nbsp;conversely not
require any previous experience with this API when first learning it
through its pysclint interface. </p>


<p>The following interfaces are currently provided.</p>


<table style="text-align: left; width: 620px; height: 96px; margin-left: 40px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">


  <tbody>


    <tr>


      <td style="width: 89px; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">pycdf</span></td>


      <td style="width: 464px;">Python
interface to
the Unidata&nbsp;<em>netCDF</em> library. <br>


See the <a href="pycdf/index.html">pycdf</a> web
page.</td>


    </tr>


    <tr>


      <td style="width: 89px; vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">pyhdf</span></td>


      <td style="width: 464px;">Python interface to
the &nbsp;NCSA <em>HDF4</em> library. <br>


See the <a href="pyhdf/index.html">pyhdf</a> web
page.</td>


    </tr>


  
  </tbody>
</table>


<p> An interface to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">MPI</span>
1.2 standard will be provided in a
near future. </p>


<p>The packages making up pysclint were previously hosted at
Institut Maurice-Lamontagne (IML).
It became more practical to move the project to Sourceforge.net, which
was
done in July 2005.
We want to thank IML for its previous support.</p>
