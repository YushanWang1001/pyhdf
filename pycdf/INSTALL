Installing the pycdf python package.

pycdf has been successfully installed under python 2.2 and above on
the following platforms:
  -Linux, kernel 2.4.19 and above
  -Tru64 4.0.f and above
  -Solaris 8
  -AIX 4

Please inform the author (gosselina@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) of any
successfull installation on a different platform, and of
problems encountered.

To install, follow these steps.

1-Install the netcdf library. Source code is available at:
  www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf. Binary packages
  are available for most popular environments.

2-Install the python Numeric package. Source code is
  available at: numpy.sourceforge.net. Binary packages
  are available for most popular environments.

3-Uncompress and untar the pycdf tar ball, then cd to the
  pycdf-xxx directory just created.

4-If your netcdf library lives in a non-standard directory
  (eg not on the standard library search path),
  edit the `setup.py' file and locate the line reading:

    #library_dirs=["non standard path where libs live"],

  Remove the pound sign to uncomment the line, and enter the non-
  standard path in quotes between the square brackets. For ex.:

    library_dirs = ["/usr/local/netcdf-3.5.0/lib"],

5-As root, execute the command:

    python setup.py install

Enjoy!
