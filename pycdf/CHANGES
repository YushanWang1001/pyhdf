List of changes to 'pycdf' since the initial release.

pycdf-0.5-3
  July 16 2005
    Interim release.
    
    -pycdf classes are now 'new-style' classes (they derive from 'object').
    -Updated documentation.

pycdf-0.5-2
  July 20 2003
    -Corrected unfortunate error in the 'setup.py' script.
    -Forced closing of the dataset when the python object
     referring to it goes out of scope.
    -To avoid name clashes with an upcoming 'pyhdf' package,
     all netCDF constants heve been moved to a new 'NC' class.
     As a consequence, instead of saying eg:"CDF(<file>,READ)", 
     one must now write: "CDF(<file>,NC.READ). Since this change 
     comes really early in the lifetime of 'pycdf', it is hoped 
     it will not impact too many users.
     *** EXAMPLES MUST BE DOWNLOADED AFRESH ***
    -List of names imported by an "from pycdf import *" statement
     has been substantially cleaned up.

pycdf-0.5-1
  July 19 2003
    -Initial release.
