    Introduction
    ------------
    pycdf is a python wrapper around the netCDF C API. It augments the API
    with an OOP framework where a netcdf file is accessed through 4 different
    types of objects:
      CDF      netCDF dataset (file)
      CDFDim   netCDF dimension
      CDFVar   netCDF variable
      CDFAttr  netCDF attribute (dataset or variable attribute)
    
    pycdf key features are as follows.
    
      -pycdf is a complete implementation of the functionnality offered
       by the netCDF C API. For almost every function offered by the C API 
       exists an equivalent method in one of the pycdf classes. pycdf does not
       hide anything, and everything possible in C implementation is also
       achievable in python. It is quite straightforward to go from C to python
       and vice-versa, and to learn pycdf usage by refering to the C API
       documentation.
       
      -pycdf method names bear a strong resemblance to their C counterparts,
       but are generally much simpler.
       
      -A few high-level python methods have been developped to ease
       programmer's task. Of greatest interest are those allowing netCDF
       access through familiar python idioms:   
         -netCDF attributes can be read/written like ordinary python class
          attributes
         -netCDF variables can be read/written like ordinary python lists using
          multidimensional indices and so-called "extended slice syntax", with
          strides allowed
       See "High level attribute access" and "High level variable access"
       sections for details.
    
       Other python specific helper methods are:
         -pycdf can transparently put the dataset into define and data mode,
          thus relieving the programmer from having to call redef() and
          enddef(). See CDF.datamode() method for details.
         -pycdf offers methods to retrieve a dictionnary of the attributes,
          dimensions and variables defined on a dataset, and of the attributes
          set on a variable. Querying a dataset is thus geatly simplified.
          See methods CDF.attributes(), CDF.dimensions(), CDF.variables(),
          and CDFVar.attributes() for details.
          
      -netCDF variables are read/written through "Numeric", a sophisticated
       python package for efficiently handling multi-dimensional arrays of
       numbers. Numeric can nicely extend the netCDF functionnality, eg.
       adding/subtracting arrays with the '+/-' operators.
    
    Package components
    ------------------
    pycdf is a proper Python package, eg a collection of modules stored under
    a directory named by the package and holding an __init__.py file.
    The pycdf package is composed of 3 modules:
       _pycdfext   C extension module responsible for wrapping the
                   netcdf library
       pycdfext    python module implementing some utility functions
                   complementing the extension module
       pycdf       python module which wraps the extension module inside
                   an OOP framework
    
    _pycdfext and pycdfest were generated with the SWIG preprocessor.
    SWIG is however *not* needed to run the package. Those two modules
    are meant to do their work in the background, and should never be called
    directly. Only 'pycdf' should be imported by the user program.
      
    Prerequisites
    -------------
      The following software must be installed in order for pycdf to
      work.
      
      netCDF library
        pycdf does *not* include the netCDF library, which must
        be installed separately. netCDF is available at
        "www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf".
    
      Numeric python package
        netCDF variables are read/written using the array data type provided
        by the python Numeric package. It is available at
        "numpy.sourceforge.net".
    
    Documentation
    -------------
    pycdf has been written so as to stick as closely as possible to 
    the naming conventions and calling sequences documented inside the
    "NetCDF Users Guide for C" manual. Even if pycdf gives an OOP twist
    to the C API, the C manual can be easily used as a documentary source
    for pycdf, once the class to which a method belongs has been
    identified, and of course once requirements imposed by the Python
    langage have been taken into account. Consequently, this documentation
    will not attempt to provide an exhaustive coverage of the netCDF
    library. For this, the user is referred to the above mentioned manual.
      
    This document (in both its text and html versions) has been completely
    produced using "pydoc", the Python documentation generator (which
    made its debut in the 2.1 release). pydoc can also be used
    as an on-line help tool. For example, to know everything about
    the CDFVar class, say:
      
      >>> from pydoc import help
      >>> from pycdf import *
      >>> help(CDFVar)
    
    To be more specific and get help only for the get() method of the
    CDFVar class:
    
      >>> help(CDFVar.get)   # or...
      >>> help(vinst.get)    # if vinst is a CDFVar instance
      
    
    Summary of differences between pycdf and C API
    ----------------------------------------------
    Most of the differences between the pycdf and C API can
    be summarized as follows.
    
      Python method vs C function names:
    
       -Prefix 'nc_' has been dropped everywhere.
       -Suffixes that became redundant given the class to which the
        method belongs have been dropped. For example,  C function 
        'nc_inq_var()' belongs to python class CDFVar (the class
        encapsulating methods having to do with a netCDF 'variable').
        The '_var' suffix is now redundant, and the method name
        simplifes to 'inq()'.
       -The same reasoning has led to the dropping of redundant
        infixes. For ex., C function 'nc_inq_dimname()' belongs
        to the 'CDFDim' class (the class describing a netCDF
        'dimension'), and has been renamed 'inq_name' since the
        'dim' infix is now redundant.
     
      Internal vs external data types
    
       -The C API offers the programmer the possibility of automatically 
        converting between netCDF external types (eg: NC.BYTE, NC.SHORT, 
        NC.INT, etc) and a vast array of C "internal" types (unsigned char, 
        char, short, etc). Each basic function responsible for reading/writing
        a value then comes in a variety of different flavors, one per internal
        type (eg: nc_put_var_text(), nc_put_var_uchar(), nc_put_var_schar,
        etc). 
       -pycdf does not offer any such type conversion, mostly because this
        would be either meaningless in the context of the Python language,
        or because type conversion is better left as an explicit task to
        the programmer outside of the netCDF context.
        Values returned by the "get" methods always match the netCDF type
        (NC.BYTE, NC.SHORT and NC.INT are returned as integers, 
        NC.FLOAT and NC.DOUBLE as reals, and NC.CHAR as strings).
        Conversely, values written by the "put" methods are taken verbatim
        from the argument lists and outputted according to the underlying
        netCDF type, using the function variant allowing the maximum value
        range (eg: "long" variant for integers, "double" variant for reals).
        
      Return values
      
       -In the C API, every function returns an integer status code, and values
        computed by the function are returned through one or more pointers
        passed as arguments.
       -In pycdf, error statuses are returned through the Python exception
        mechanism, and values are returned as the method result. When the
        C API specifies that multiple values are returned, pycdf returns a 
        tuple of values, which are ordered similarly as the pointers in the
        C function argument list.
       
    
    Error handling
    --------------
    All errors are reported by pycdf using the Python exception mechanism.
    pycdf then raises an CDFError exception (a subclass of Exception). 
    The message accompanying the error is a 3-element tuple composed
    in order of: the name of the function/method which raised the exception,
    an integer error code, and a string explaining the meaning of this
    error code. A negative error code signals an error raised by the
    netCDF C library, and the string is then identical to the one obtained
    through the strerror() function call. An error code of 0 indicates
    an error signaled by the python layer, not the netCDF C library. 
    
    Ex.:
      >>> from pycdf import *
      >>> try:
      ...   d=CDF('toto.nc')
      ... except CDFError,err:
      ...   print "pycdf reported an error in function/method:",err[0]
      ...   print "      netCDF error ",err[1],":",err[2]
      >>>
    
    High level attribute access
    ---------------------------
    
    netCDF allow setting attributes either at the dataset or the variable
    level. Attributes are names storing information (in the form of scalars,
    strings, sequences) which help interpret the dataset or variable they
    are attached to. netCDF attributes rely on a set of conventions (see the
    netCDF manual) and are not enforced in ay way by the library. The only
    exception (known to the author) is the '_FillValue' attribute which, when
    attached to a variable, sets the value that is to be stored in uninitialized
    entries of this variable. All other attributes must be interpreted at the
    application level.
    
    With pycdf, attributes can be assigned in two ways.
    
      -By calling the get()/put() method of an attribute instance. In the
       following example, dataset 'example.nc' is created, and string
       attribute 'title' is attached to the dataset and given value
       'this is an example'.
         >>> from pycdf import *
         >>> d = CDF('example.nc',NC.WRITE|NC.CREATE)  # create dataset
         >>> att = d.attr('title')               # create attribute instance
         >>> att.put(NC.CHAR, 'this is an example') # set attribute type and value
         >>> att.get()                           # get attribute value
         'this is an example'
         >>>
    
      -By handling the attribute like an ordinary Python class attribute.
       Above example can then be rewritten as follows:
         >>> from pycdf import *
         >>> d = CDF('example.nc',NC.WRITE|NC.CREATE)  # create dataset
         >>> d.title = 'this is an example'      # set attribute type and value
         >>> d.title                             # get attribute value
         'this is an example'
         >>>
    
      This applies as well to multi-valued attributes.
        >>> att = d.attr('values')               # With an attribute instance
        >>> att.put(NC.INT, (1,2,3,4,5))           
        >>> att.get()
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
        >>> d.values = (1,2,3,4,5)               # As a Python class attribute
        >>> d.values
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    When the attribute is known by its name through a string, standard
    functions `setattr()' and `getattr()' can be used to replace the dot
    notation. Above example becomes:
        >>> setattr(d, 'values', (1,2,3,4,5))
        >>> getattr(d, 'values')
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    Handling a netCDF attribute like a Python class attribute is admittedly
    more natural, and also simpler. Some control is however lost in doing so.
      -Attribute type cannot be specified. pycdf automatically selects one of
       three types according to the value(s) assigned to the attribute:
       NC.CHAR if value is a string, NC.INT if all values are integral, NC.DOUBLE
       if one value is a float. 
      -Consequently, unsigned NC.BYTE values cannot be assigned.
      -Attribute properties (length, type, index number) can only be queried
       through methods of an attribute instance.
    
    High level variable access
    --------------------------
    With pycdf, netCDF variables can be read/written in two ways.
    
    The first way is through the get()/put() methods of a variable instance.
    Those methods accept parameters to specify the starting indices, the count
    of values to read/write, and the strides along each dimension. For example,
    if 'v' is a 4x4 array:
        >>> v.get()                         # complete array
        >>> v.get(start=(0,0),count=(1,4))  # first row
        >>> v.get(start=(0,1),count=(2,2),  # second and third columns of
        ...       stride=(2,1))             # first and third row
    
    The second way is by indexing and slicing the variable like a Python
    sequence. pycdf here follows most of the rules used to index and slice
    Numeric arrays. Thus a netCDF variable can be seen as a Numeric array,
    except that data is read from/written to a file instead of memory.
    
    Extended indexing let you access variable elements with the familiar
    [i,j,...] notation, with one index per dimension. For example, if 'm' is a
    3x3x3 netCDF variable, one could write:
        >>> m[0,3,5] = m[0,5,3]
        
    When indexing is used to select a dimension in a `get' operation, this
    dimension is removed from the output array, thus reducing its rank by 1. A
    rank 0 array is converted to a scalar. Thus, for a 3x3x3 `m' variable
    (rank 3) of type int :
        >>> a = m[0]         # a is a 3x3 array (rank 2)
        >>> a = m[0,0]       # a is a 3 element array (rank 1)
        >>> a = m[0,0,0]     # a is an integer (rank 0 array becomes a scalar)
    
    Had this rule not be followed, m[0,0,0] would have resulted in a single
    element array, which could complicate computations.
    
    Extended slice syntax allows slicing netCDF variables along each of its
    dimensions, with the specification of optional strides to step through
    dimensions at regular intervals. For each dimension, the slice syntax
    is: "i:j[:stride]", the stride being optional. As with ordinary slices,
    the starting and ending values of a slice can be omitted to refer to the
    first and last element, respectively, and the end value can be negative to
    indicate that the index is measured relative to the tail instead of the
    beginning. Omitted dimensions are assumed to be sliced from beginning to
    end. Thus:
        >>> m[0]             # treated as `m[0,:,:]'.
    
    Example above with get()/put() methods can thus be rewritten as follows:
        >>> v[:]             # complete array
        >>> v[:1]            # first row
        >>> v[::2,1:3]       #  second and third columns of first and third row
    
    Indexes and slices can be freely mixed, eg:
        >>> m[:2,3,1:3:2]
         
    Note that, countrary to indexing, a slice never reduces the rank of the
    output array, even if its length is 1. For example, given a 3x3x3 `m'
    variable:
        >>> a = m[0]         # indexing: a is a 3x3 array (rank 2)
        >>> a = m[0:1]       # slicing: a is a 1x3x3 array (rank 3)
        
    As can easily be seen, extended slice syntax is much more elegant and
    compact, and offers a few possibilities not easy to achieve with the
    get()/put() methods. Negative indices offer a nice example:
        >>> v[-2:]                         # last two rows
        >>> v[-3:-1]                       # second and third row
        >>> v[:,-1]                        # last column
    
    The only features exclusively available with the get()/put) methods are the
    specification of a mapping vector (which could be used for ex. to
    transpose an array), and the handling of NC.BYTE type values as unsigned.
    
    Reading/setting multivalued netCDF attributes and variables
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Multivalued netCDF attributes are set using a python sequence (tuple or
    list). Reading such an attribute returns a python list. The easiest way to
    read/set a netCDF attribute is by handling it like a Python class attribute
    (see "High level attribute access"). For example:
        >>> d=CDF('test.nc',NC.WRITE|NC.CREATE)  # create dataset
        >>> d.integers = (1,2,3,4)         # define multivalued integer attr
        >>> d.integers                     # get the attribute value
        [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    The easiest way to set multivalued netCDF variables is to assign to an
    indexed subset of the variable, using "[:]" to assign to the whole variable
    (see "High level variable access"). The assigned value can be a python
    sequence, which can be multi-leveled when assigning to a multdimensional
    variable. For example:
        >>> d=CDF('test.nc',NC.WRITE|NC.CREATE)         # create dataset
        >>> d3=d.def_dim('d1',3)                  # create dim. of length 3
        >>> v1=d.def_var('v1',NC.INT,d3)             # 3-elem vector
        >>> v1[:]=[1,2,3]                         # assign 3-elem python list
        >>> v2=d.def_var('d2',NC.INT,(d3,d3))        # create 3x3 variable
               # The list assigned to v2 is composed
               # of 3 lists, each representing a row of v2.
        >>> v2[:]=[[1,2,3],[11,12,13],[21,22,23]]
    
    The assigned value can also be a Numeric array. Rewriting example above:
        >>> v1=array([1,2,3])
        >>> v2=array([[1,2,3],[11,12,13],[21,22,23])
    
    Note how we use indexing expressions 'v1[:]' and 'v2[:]' when assigning
    using python sequences, and just the variable names when assigning Numeric
    arrays.
    
    Reading a netCDF variable always returns a Numeric array, except if
    indexing is used and produces a rank-0 array, in which case a scalar is
    returned.
    
    Working with scalar variables
    -----------------------------
    
    A scalar (rank-0) variable is created inside a dataset by calling
    dataset method def_var() with an empty (or omitted) dimension sequence, eg:
       >>> cdf = CDF(...)
       >>> cdf.automode()
       >>> temp = cdf.def_var('temp', NC.FLOAT)    # 'temp' is a scalar variable
    
    Now, methods put() and get() of this variable can be called 
    to set and get the variable value, and attributes can be set on the
    variable in the usual way, eg:
       >>> temp.put(12)
       >>> temp.units = "celsius"
       >>> print temp.get(), temp.units       # prints "12.0 celsius"
       
    For uniformity purposes, the slicing expression "[:]" is also applicable
    to scalar variables, even if they are not sequences at all.
    Purists may disagree, but otherwise scalar variables could only be accessed
    through get() and put() methods, preventing writing generic code to handle
    variables using slicing constructs. We can thus write:
       >>> temp[:] = 12                      # equivalent to temp.put(12)
       >>> print temp[:]                     # equivalent to "print temp.get()"
    
    
    Working with the unlimited dimension
    ------------------------------------
    
    Inside a dataset, one dimension can be designated as being 'unlimited',
    allowing variables based on that dimension to dynamically grow
    along that dimension. An unlimited dimension is defined by calling the
    dataset def_dim() method using NC.UNLIMITED as the dimension length,
    eg:
       >>> d1 = cdf.def_dim('d1', NC.UNLIMITED)
    
    A variable can be allowed to grow along that dimension if that dimension
    comes first in the variable dimension list, eg:
       >>> d2 = cdf.def_dim('d2', 5)
       >>> v = cdf.def_var('v', NC.DOUBLE, (d1, d2))
    
    Only one unlimited dimension is allowed inside a dataset, and all variables
    based on that dimension will grow "in synch".
    
    When assigning to a variable along an unlimited dimension, the indices
    must be specified if they exceed the current dimension range. Otherwise,
    only the currently existing elements along that dimension will be affected,
    irrespective of the shape of the right-hand side expression. This could be
    considered a bug (comments please...). Thus:
       >>> v[:]  = ones((4,5))     # fails: 'd1' empty, dimension left untouched
       >>> v[:4] = ones((4,5))     # works: indices 0 to 3 along 'd1' are assigned to
       >>> v[:]  = zeros((4,5))    # now works: current 'd1' 0 to 3 indices assigned to
       >>> v[:2,:2] = ones((2,2))  # assign elements 0 to 1 on dimensions 'd1' and 'd2'
    
    An unlimited dimension can be made to grow by assigning to higher and higher
    indices along that dimension. Thus:
       >>> for i in range(4,7):
       ...    v[i] = i * ones(5)  # grow dimension 'd1' from 4 to 6
    
    Making an unlimited dimension grow in a non-sequential way will allocate
    intermediate elements inside the variable, which will be initialized with
    the fill value (default one, or the one set with attribute _FillValue). So:
       >>> v._FillValue = 999.0
       >>> v[8] = ones(5)        # will fill v[7] with '999.0' fill values
    
    The same holds true for other variables based on the unlimited dimension. They
    will all grow in synch when the dimension range is extended, and newly allocated
    elements inside those variables will be set to their variable fill value.
    
    
    Open issues and current limitiations
    ------------------------------------
    
    The following limitations now affect the pycdf package. They may be lifted out
    in future releases. Users are encouraged to send their votes on those
    issues.
    
    Assigning non-conforming array shapes.
    
      pycdf currently does not check the shapes of arrays involved in the
      assignment to netCDF variables. Thus, the following code will proceed without
      errors.
         >>> d = cdf.def_dim('d', 5)
         >>> v = cdf.def_var('v', NC.INT, d)
         >>> v[:] = ones(10)     # indices 5 to 9 silently ignored
    
      In the current implementation, pycdf simply "linearizes" the right-hand side,
      assigning elements to the left-hand until all designated elements have been
      assigned to. This is why , when assigning to a variable along an unlimited
      dimension, the indices must be specified if they exceed the current dimension
      range (see "Working with the unlimited dimension").
    
      This behavior may be considered a bug by some, who would like to see
      pycdf raise an exception when trying to assign a non-conformant array shape
      to a netCDF variable.
    
    'Numeric' vs 'numarray' support
    
      pycdf has not been tested so far with the 'numarray' package, which is expected
      to make 'Numeric' obsolete in some future. Some users have reported that
      they could import 'numarray' in place of 'Numeric', at the cost however of
      having to cast returned 'Numeric' arrays to 'numarray' arrays. 
    
    
    Functions summary
    -----------------
    pycdf defines the following functions.

       strerror()     return the string associated with a netCDF error code
    
    Classes summary
    ---------------
    pycdf defines the following classes.
    
      CDF  The CDF class desribes a netCDF dataset. It encapsulates a
           netCDF file descriptor (refered to by 'ncid' in the C manual),
           and all the netCDF top-level functions (those not dealing with
           dimensions, variables or attributes). It contains constructors
           to create instances of all those object types.
    
           To create a CDF instance call the CDF() constructor.
    
           methods:
             constructors
               CDF()       open an existing netCDF file or create a new
                           one, returning a CDF instance
               attr()      get an existing or define a new dataset attribute,
                           returning a CDFAttr (attribute) instance

                           returning a CDFDim (dimension) instance
               inq_dimid() equivalent to dim()
               def_dim()   define a new dimension,
                           returning a CDFDim (dimension) instance

                           returning a CDFVar (variable) instance
               inq_varid() equivalent to var()
               def_var()   define a new variable
                           returning a CDFVar (variable) instance
    
             dataset manipulation

                            of the dataset define and data mode.
               datamode()   enter data mode, ignoring error if already in
                            this mode
               enddef()     switch the dataset to data mode
               definemode() enter define mode, ignoring error if already
                            in this mode

    Examples
    --------
    
    Example-1
    
    The following simple example exercises some important pycdf methods. It
    shows how to create a netCDF dataset, define attributes and dimensions,
    create variables, and assign their contents.
    
    Suppose we have a series of text files each defining a 2-dimensional real
    matrix. First line holds the matrix dimensions, and following lines hold
    matrix values, one row per line. The following procedure will transfer to
    a netCDF variable the contents of any one of those text files. The
    procedure also computes the matrix min and max values, storing them as
    variable attributes. It also assigns to the variable the group of
    attributes passed as a dictionnary by the calling program. Note how simple
    such an assignment becomes with pycdf: the dictionnary can contain any
    number of attributes, of different types, single or multi-valued. Doing
    the same in a conventional language would be much more challenging.
    
    Error checking is minimal, to keep example as simple as possible
    (admittedly a rather poor excuse ...).
    
    
      from Numeric import *
      from pycdf import *
    
      def txtToCDF(txtFile, ncFile, varName, attr):
        # Transfer contents of 'txtFile' to NC.FLOAT variable 'varName' inside
        # netCDF file 'ncFile'. `attr' is a dictionnary holding attributes
        # to assign to the variable.
    
        try:   # Catch CDFError exceptions
            # Open netCDF file in update mode, creating it if inexistent.
            nc = CDF(ncFile, NC.WRITE|NC.CREATE)
            # Automatically set define and data modes.
            nc.automode()
            # Open text file and get matrix dimensions on first line
            # (admittedly a flaky design, it would be better to compute those
            # values programmatically).
            txt = open(txtFile)
            ni, nj = map(int, txt.readline().split()) # split fields, then
                                                      # convert to ints
            # Defined netCDF dimensions. Should check for already existing
            # dimensions of that name.
            dimi = nc.def_dim(varName + '_i', ni) # create name like 'depth_i'
            dimj = nc.def_dim(varName + '_j', nj) # and 'depth_j'
            # Define netCDF variable of type NC.FLOAT with those dimensions.
            # Should check that this variable does not already exist.
            var = nc.def_var(varName, NC.FLOAT, (dimi, dimj))
            # Assign attributes passed as argument inside dict `attr'.
            for attrName in attr.keys():
                setattr(var, attrName, attr[attrName])
            # Load variable with lines of data. Compute min and max
            # over the whole matrix.
            i = 0
            while i < ni:
                # split fields, converting them to a list of floats
                elems = map(float, txt.readline().split())
                # assign to netCDF array
                var[i] = elems
                # compute min and max
                minE = min(elems)
                maxE = max(elems)
                if i:
                    minVal = min(minVal, minE)
                    maxVal = max(maxVal, maxE)
                else:
                    minVal = minE
                    maxVal = maxE
                i += 1
            # Set variable min and max attributes.
            var.minVal = minVal
            var.maxVal = maxVal
            # Close files (not really necessary, since closing is
            # automatic when file objects go out of scope.
            nc.close()
            txt.close()
        except CDFError, msg:
            print "CDF error:",msg
    
    We could now call the procedure as follows:
    
      ncFile  = 'table.nc'   # netCDF file name
      # Transfer contents of 'temp.txt' to variable 'temperature'
      txtToCDF('temp.txt', ncFile, 'temperature',
               # Dictionary of attributes to set on netCDF variable
               {'title'      : 'temperature matrix',
                'units'      : 'celsius',
                'precision'  : 0.01,
                'valid_range': (-2.8,27.0)})  # Note multivalued attribute
    
      # Transfer contents of 'depth.txt' to variable 'depth'
      txtToCDF('depth.txt', ncFile, 'depth',
               # Dictionary of attributes to set on netCDF variable
               {'title'      : 'depth matrix',
                'units'      : 'meters',
                'precision'  : 0.1,
                'valid_range': (0, 500.0)})   # Note multivalued attribute
    
    
    
    Example 2
    
    This example shows a usefull python program that will display the
    structure of any netCDF file whose name is given on the command line.
    After the netCDF file is opened, high level inquiry methods are called
    to obtain dictionnaries descrybing dataset attributes, dimensions and
    variables. The rest of the program mostly consists in nicely formatting
    the contents of those dictionaries.

     |  The CDF class describes a netCDF dataset.
     |  To instantiate a netCDF dataset, call the CDF()
     |  constructor.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __del__(self)
     |      Close the associated dataset when a CDF instance is deleted,
     |      if this has not already been done.
     |  
     |  __getattr__(self, name)
     |  
     |  __init__(self, path, mode=0)
     |      Create a new netCDF dataset or open an existing one.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |        path    name of the netCDF file to open
     |        mode    file opening mode; this mode is set of binary flags
     |                which can be or'ed together
     |                    
     |                    NC.CREATE  combined with NC.WRITE to create file if it
     |                               does not exist
     |                    NC.TRUNC   if NC.WRITE is set, overwrite file if it

     |                               case the file is created
     |                    NC.SHARE   mimimize buffering to improve file sharing 
     |                               with other processes
     |      
     |          Once the file is opened, it is left in define mode if

     |  attr(self, name_id)
     |      Obtain an CDFAttr instance for a global attribute,
     |      given its name or its index number. The attribute may or may
     |      not exist.
     |      Dataset mode: does not matter.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |        name_id   If a string argument is used, it is interpreted as the
     |                  attribute name, which may be non-existent. 
     |                  Otherwise, it must be a non negative integer

     |                 define or data mode, depending on the call to be made,
     |                 thus relieving the programmer of the responsability
     |                 to set the dataset mode with calls to redef()/enddef()
     |                 methods. If false (== 0), dataset mode must be set
     |                 explicitly.

     |                    specify an empty sequence to define a scalar
     |                    variable; for a one-dimensional variable, the

     |                    need to be entered as a sequence; for a record variable
     |                    (eg using an unlimited dimension), the unlimited

     |                    is assumed to be the dimension name, and the
     |                    method behaves as inq_dimid(). Otherwise, the

     |        Otherwise, dictionnary where each key is a dimension name.
     |        If parameter `full' is false, key value is the dimension
     |        length. If `full' is true, key value is a tuple with the
     |        following elements:
     |          - dimension length
